# The Database Design Process
+ three major stages in database design
  - Requirements analysis
    + what exactly the database is needed for
    + what data will be stored
    + how the data items relate to each other
  - Conceptual design
    + distill requirements into a formal description of the database design
  - Logical design
    + map the database design onto an actual database management system and database tables
# The Entity Relationship Model
+ A model which can help transform the requirements into a formal description of the entities and relationships(conceptual design) that appear in the database.
+ Entities
  - distinct objects
+ Relationships
  - associations between these entities
+ Example:
  - Database: University
  - Entities: Student and Course
  - Relationship: Enrollment
## Representing Entities
Note: the tool I use here is an online tool called [erdplus](https://erdplus.com/). You can use other tools to create ER models.
+ entity set 
  - a rectangle containing the entity name
  
  ![entity](../Resources/4-entity.png)
  
+ attributes
  - Attributes describe the entity
  - you need to understand different types of attributes
    + simple attributes: an simple oval
    + composed attributes: an oval(sometimes the attribute name is surrounded by a pair of ()) connected by other ovals(these are simple attributes)
    + multivalued attribute: two ovals
    + key: 
      - candidate keys
      - primary key: an oval with underlined name
  - attribute characteristics
    + Attribute values are chosen from a **domain** of legal values
    + Attributes can be empty(NULL value), but primary key must be **NOT NULL**.
    + You should think carefully when classifying an attribute as multivalued
    + For some applications, no combination of attributes can uniquely identify an entity (or it would be too unwieldy to use a large composite key), so we create an artificial attribute.
  ![attribute](../Resources/4-attribute.png)
## Representing Relationships
+ Types of relationships
  - one-to-one(1:1)
  - one-to-many(1:N)
  - many-to-many(M:N)
+ In an ER diagram, we represent a relationship set with a named diamond。
+ The number of entities on either side of a relationship (the cardinality of the relation- ship) define the key constraints of the relationship.
  
![relationship2](../Resources/4-relationship2.png)
  
## Partial and Total Participation(Mandatory and optional relationships)
+ Relationships between entities can be optional or compulsory.
+ Example:
  - We could decide that a person is considered to be a customer only if they have bought a product(Total Participation).
  - We can have people listed as customers in our database who never buy a product(Partial Participation). 
  
  ![relationship](../Resources/4-relationship.png)
  
## Entity or Attribute?
+ Is the item of direct interest to the database?
  - Objects of direct interest should be entities
  - Information that describes them should be stored in attributes.
+ Does the item have components of its own?
  - If so, a separate entity might be the best solution.
+ Can the object have multiple instances?
  - If so, the cleanest way to do this is to represent the object as a separate entity.
+ Is the object often nonexistent or unknown?
  - If so, it is effectively an attribute of only some of the entities, and it would be better to model it as a separate entity rather than as an attribute that is often empty.

  ![student2](../Resources/4-student2.png)
  
  
## Entity or Relationship?
+ An easy way to decide whether an object should be an entity or a relationship is to map nouns in the requirements to entities, and to map the verbs to relations.
+ Example: “A degree program is made up of one or more courses,” 
  - entities: degree and course
  - relationship: is made up of
## Intermediate Entities
+ It is often possible to conceptually simplify many-to-many relationships by replacing the many-to-many relationship with a new intermediate entity (sometimes called an associate entity) and connecting the original entities through a many-to-one and a one-to-many relationship.
+ Example: A passenger can book a seat on a flight(many-to-many).
  - Any given flight can have many passengers with a booking.
  - Any given passenger can have bookings on many flights.
  
  ![4-intermediate1.png](../Resources/4-intermediate1.png)
  
  - intermediate entity: the booking
    + Each passenger can be involved in multiple bookings, but each booking belongs to a single passenger(one-to-many).
    + there can be many bookings for a given flight, but each booking is for a single flight(one-to-many).
    + Since each booking must be associated with a par- ticular passenger and flight, the booking entity participates totally in the relationships with these entities. This total participation could not be captured effectively in the representation in figure above.
    
    ![4-intermediate2.png](../Resources/4-intermediate2.png)
  
## Weak and Strong Entities
+ In database design, we can omit some key information for (week) entities that are dependent on other (strong) entities.
+ The relationship between a week entity and a strong entity is called an **identifying relationship**.
+ In the ER diagram, we show weak entities and identifying relationships with double lines, and the partial key of a weak entity with a dashed underline.

# Entity Relationship Modeling Examples
+ The music database




+ The flight database
+ The  **university database** captures the details of students, courses, and grades for a university.
  - university students
  - courses
  - the semester a student took a particular course (and his mark and grade if he completed it)
  - what degree program each student is enrolled in

## Step 1: draw up a clear list of requirements for the database
+ The university offers one or more programs.
+ A program is made up of one or more courses.
+ A student must enroll in a program.
+ A student takes the courses that are part of her program.
+ A program has a name, a program identifier, the total credit points required to graduate, and the year it commenced.
+ A course has a name, a course identifier, a credit point value, and the year it commenced.
+ Students have one or more given names, a surname, a student identifier, a date of birth, and the year they first enrolled. We can treat all given names as a single object —for example, “John Paul.”
+ When a student takes a course, the year and semester he attempted it are recorded. When he finishes the course, a grade (such as A or B) and a mark (such as 60 percent) are recorded.
+ Each course in a program is sequenced into a year (for example, year 1) and a semester (for example, semester 1).

# Using the Entity Relationship Model
## Step 3: Mapping Entities and Relationships to Database Tables
+ Step 3.1: Map the entities to database tables
  - For each strong entity, create a table comprising its attributes and designate the primary key. The parts of any composite attributes are also included here.
  - For each weak entity, create a table comprising its attributes and including the primary key of its owning entity. The primary key of the owning entity is known as a foreign key here, because it’s a key not of this table, but of another table. The primary key of the table for the weak entity is the combination of the foreign key and the partial key of the weak entity. If the relationship with the owning entity has any attributes, add them to this table.
  - For each multivalued attribute of an entity, create a table comprising the entity’s pri- mary key and the attribute.
+ Step 3.2: Map the relationships to database tables
  - For each one-to-one relationship between two entities, include the primary key of one entity as a foreign key in the table belonging to the other. If one entity participates totally in the relationship, place the foreign key in its table. If both participate totally in the relationship, consider merging them into a single table.
  - For each nonidentifying one-to-many relationship between two entities, include the primary key of the entity on the “1” side as a foreign key in the table for the entity on the “N” side. Add any attributes of the relationship in the table alongside the foreign key. Note that identifying one-to-many relationships (between a weak entity and its owning entity) are captured as part of the entity-mapping stage.
  - For each many-to-many relationship between two entities, create a new table contain- ing the primary key of each entity as the primary key, and add any attributes of the relationship. This step helps to identify intermediate entities.
  - For each relationship involving more than two entities, create a table with the primary keys of all the participating entities, and add any attributes of the relationship.
